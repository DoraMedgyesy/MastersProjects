# N-Gram Language Modeling & Word Vector Analysis

This project implements an **N-gram language model** with optional smoothing, text generation, and evaluation via perplexity.  
It also includes **count-based word vector generation**, **dimensionality reduction (SVD)**, **2D visualization**, and comparison with **pre-trained GloVe embeddings**.

##  Project Structure

- `N-Gram_Language_Modelling/results`: Output folder for n-gram results and generated text
- `N-Gram_Language_Modelling/brown_100.txt`: Input corpus (Brown)
- `N-Gram_Language_Modelling/N-Gram_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full implementation

## How to Run

Manually run the notebook `N-Gram_Model.ipynb`.

## Acknowledgements

This project builds on starter code and materials provided by the professor as part of the **Natural Language Processing** course at **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU)**, 2025.  
The assignment structure, some utility functions, and datasets were supplied by the instructor. All additional implementation, analysis, and documentation were done independently.
